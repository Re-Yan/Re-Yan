 Hi ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m @Re-Yan a Computer Science student learning software development and is currently focusing on the C programming language (September 2022). 

DISCLAIMER: Most of the projects here are going to be unpolished and a bit messy, but im hoping to improve day by day! 

* If you have any criticisms or suggestions, feel free to give me a heads up 
as I highly appreciate feedback and guidance from more experienced programmers. Cheers! âœ¨
